	   		<p>The record-long U.S. economic expansion looks unlikely to run out of steam any time soon. We see a limited near-term risk of the traditional catalysts that bring expansions to an end — financial vulnerabilities leading to dislocations or deleveraging, or economic overheating that prompts central banks to overtighten policy. The U.S. economy has only recently hit full capacity, entering the “late” stage of the cycle that can often run for an extended period. See the Stretching the cycle chart and our Putting economic cycles in context interactive graphic. Our BlackRock macro dashboard indicates global growth should decelerate further but sees the global expansion running on for longer, with central banks helping support looser financial conditions.</p>

	   		<p>We see the ECB providing additional stimulus — in the form of a shift in forward guidance, lower rates or a restarting of quantitative easing (QE) — ahead of the end of President Mario Draghi’s term in October. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan is mulling more stimulus measures as inflation shows no sign of reaching target and the yen has remained strong. Yet it has limited policy room with already sizable asset purchases and a negative policy rate. </p>
	   		
	   		<p>The decisively dovish turn in global monetary policy since the start of the year and resulting plunge in bond yields bode well for risk assets, in our view, barring any major escalation in geopolitical tensions. We see asset valuations as reasonable in both equity and credit markets, particularly in a world of structurally lower interest rates over the long run. This argues for maintaining sizable equity exposure, especially to U.S. stocks, and favors high-yielding EM debt because we see income as crucial in a low-yield world. </p>
	   		
	   		<p>What are the key risks? Global trade and strategic tensions between the U.S. and China could escalate or broaden to the Americas, Europe or other Asian economies. This could hit market sentiment, lead to an extended lull in major economies and weigh on global growth. Even if monetary and fiscal policy support helps extend the life of this cycle, we could still face the prospect of slower growth and higher inflation. Heightened macro uncertainty could also herald a shift to a new regime of more frequent risk asset selloffs and higher financial market volatility. It is why we believe that building portfolio resilience is critical as this cycle continues to age. </p>
