					    <strong>This information is not intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or strategy. Forecasts are not a reliable indicator of future performance.</strong>BlackRock Investment Institute, July 2019. Data as of February 28, 2019. Notes: The chart shows BlackRock’s capital market assumptions (CMAs), or expected nominal returns across asset classes on a 10-year horizon, in U.S. dollar terms. Our CMAs generate market, or beta, geometric return expectations. Asset return expectations are gross of fees. The bars represent the uncertainty around our mean return estimates. The lighter, larger bar is based on the 25th and 75th percentile of expected return outcomes — the interquartile range — of thousands of potential return pathways generated by a Monte Carlo simulation. The darker, smaller bar shows the distribution of values around BlackRock’s mean expected returns. The difference in the size of mean return uncertainty between assets comes down to particularities of each asset class, including the ability to estimate returns and data availability. Indices are unmanaged and used for illustrative purposes only. They are not intended to be indicative of any fund or strategy’s performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

	   		<p>Portfolio resilience is always crucial. Yet greater resilience is called for in a period of elevated macro uncertainty or at a vulnerable stage of the cycle. This is what we refer to as conditional resilience — conditional on how investors assess the current state of the markets. It is about taking a modestly defensive posture against concerns that currently are running higher than usual. </p>

	   		<p>Our market views reflect such a stance because of rising protectionism and geopolitical frictions. Lowering risk is one dimension of conditional resilience; seeking protection is the other. We believe government bonds play an important role in portfolios by serving as a buffer against selloffs of risk assets. We see them as crucial diversifiers. </p>
	   		
	   		<p>Unconditional resilience refers to investors acknowledging there is always fundamental uncertainty about long-term returns, irrespective of the stage of the economic or market cycle they believe they are in. Relying on historical data alone is not enough to inform views for strategic, or long-term, investing horizons, in our view. </p>
	   		
	   		<p>Consider the different paths of two economies that looked very similar at the end of the 19th century: the U.S. and Argentina. With the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to suppose that the choice between them was obvious. But for investors at the time, armed only with what they had observed until then, it would not have been. Fundamental uncertainty is greater than what a look in the rear view mirror implies.</p>
	   		
	   		<p>Risks tied to deglobalization and climate change — such as those detailed in Getting physical of April 2019 — represent such long-term uncertainty. This is why our approach to portfolio construction looks at multiple potential return pathways. In a world where powerful long-term trends are playing out over decades, assuming certainty about average long-term returns seems problematic. We incorporate uncertainty in our long-term return expectations as a result. See the Returns and uncertainty chart. </p>

	   		<p>The wider uncertainty bands, such as for U.S. small cap or EM equities, represent asset classes where we have lower conviction about our mean return estimates. An asset allocation process that incorporates such uncertainty results in a more diverse portfolio than typical approaches that assume long-run returns are known with precision, in our view. </p>
