Notes: The chart shows the cumulative performance of the MSCI World Index rebased to 0 on July 1, 2016. The performance is broken down into the “growth effect” and “uncertainty effect”. We estimate the degree to which developed market real yields and equities move together as a simple measure of the growth effect — markets pricing in changes in growth expectations — drawing on the methodology used in the 2014 IMF paper News and Monetary Shocks at a High Frequency: A Simple Approach. We label the portion of equity returns unexplained by growth as the uncertainty effect. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Indexes are unmanaged and not subject to fees.

	   		<p>Geopolitical tensions have heightened macro uncertainty, leading to a wider range of potential economic and market outcomes ahead. The escalation in trade conflicts between the U.S. and its major trading partners has become the primary risk to the long global expansion, in our view, rather than traditional late-cycle concerns relating to overheating or recession. In the near term, tariffs and the uncertainty around trade policy could deliver a one-off boost to prices, damage business confidence, and discourage capital spending. This comes at a time when our Inflation GPS already points to upside risk in U.S. inflation in coming months.</p>

	   		<p>The longer-term risk: The unraveling of global supply chains delivers a supply shock that saps productivity growth, reinforces a slowdown in potential output and leads to higher inflation. We find that the uncertainty stemming from the trade threats and tit-for-tat responses have already taken a toll on developed market equities. See the Nagging uncertainty chart. We break down the cumulative performance of DM equities by determining whether the joint moves in equities and government bond yields are driven by changes in growth expectations or factors unrelated to growth — which we attribute to uncertainty.</p>
	   		
	   		<p>The uncertainty effect has hovered sideways since the start of the year and, therefore, may not have taken on board the escalation in trade tensions. This poses risks to equity markets as we expect the strategic tensions between the U.S. and China to persist, even if markets cheer a temporary truce on trade. As a result, we favor moderately reducing portfolio risk overall. For U.S. dollar investors this may include an allocation to cash-like instruments.</p>
	   		
	   		<p>Trade tensions have already caused global growth to slow and we expect further fallout that may weaken domestic spending. Yet central banks have been quick to pivot to more dovish policy stances. This indicates they are ready to provide more stimulus to reduce downside risks, even though it is not clear that monetary policy stimulus can effectively offset the protectionist push. We expect U.S. growth to cool to around trend-like levels just below a 2% annual rate. The eurozone is steadying after last year’s abrupt slowdown, in part caused by China.</p>
	   		
	   		<p>China’s growth is finding its footing but looks to be at risk of staying sluggish due to the tariff fallout. We expect Beijing to be quick to roll out fiscal stimulus to help underpin growth if the economy wobbles but believe markets are overly optimistic about the effect. We expect any stimulus to stabilize growth, but not to accelerate it. Overall, we see weaker growth in China and its fallout on the eurozone limiting any upside to global growth.</p>
