					<h1>Buying time <br/> amid rising protectionism</h1> <p>Our June 12-13 Outlook Forum in London brought together roughly 100 BlackRock investment professionals to debate the prospects of the global economy, policy and markets. We give a flavor of the Forum’s discussions, and refresh our themes and asset views in this publication.</p>
					<p>We update our three 2019 investment themes in light of our view that trade disputes and geopolitical tensions are now the key drivers for the global economy and markets. A U.S.-led protectionist push has increased downside risks to the global economy — and widened the range of potential outcomes ahead. We highlight how a significant dovish shift by central banks could nevertheless buy investors time, stretching this economic cycle and supporting risk assets. We explain how the uncertain global backdrop argues for a more overall defensive approach in portfolios. See the boxes on the right for a deep dive on each theme. </p>
					<p>Structural U.S.-China competition is at the center of geopolitical uncertainty. The tensions go beyond trade, extending to strategic concerns over domination of next-generation technologies and their implications for national security. We explain the pivotal role of China’s economy and why we believe markets may be overestimating the country’s efforts to boost growth. We then examine how investors can deal with low for longer bond yields.</p>
					<p>Our Outlook Forum featured two key debates. We discussed whether deglobalization could gradually reverse a long trend of subdued inflation, steady productivity growth and soaring corporate profit margins. And we debated how central banks can respond to the low-growth, low-inflation environment. Lastly, we detail our asset views for the next six to 12 months.</p>

						      <p>We are downgrading our global growth outlook as trade disputes and broader geopolitical tensions stoke greater macro uncertainty. The range of potential economic and market outcomes further ahead has widened. We see a lull in China’s growth due to the fallout of U.S. tariffs.</p>
						      <p><strong>Implication:</strong> We favor reducing risk amid rising protectionism, including raising some cash.</p>

						      <p>The decisively dovish shift by central banks has depressed long-term yields and should help extend the long expansion. This makes for a benign near-term environment for risk assets, in our view, although uncertainty around the outlook has risen. </p>
						      <p><strong>Implication:</strong> We stay positive on U.S. equities and like EM debt’s income potential in a low-yield world.</p>

						      <p>We believe portfolio resilience is crucial at a time of elevated macro uncertainty. We define resilience as the ability of a portfolio to withstand a variety of adverse conditions — both on a tactically defensive basis and strategically across cycles.</p>
						      <p><strong>Implication:</strong> Government bonds play an important role in building portfolio resilience — even at low yield levels.</p>
